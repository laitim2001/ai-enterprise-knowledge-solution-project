"""C16/C08 — RBAC authorization guards (W24c F3 + F8 per ADR-0027 Option A).

`require_role(*allowed)` builds a FastAPI dependency that 403s when the
authenticated user's role is not in `allowed`. It chains on `get_current_user`,
so it inherits that dependency's 401 (missing / invalid credentials) + CSRF
behaviour — a route guarded by `require_role` needs no separate
`Depends(get_current_user)`.

Usage — per-endpoint:

    @router.post("/users/invite")
    async def invite(
        actor: Annotated[AuthenticatedUser, Depends(require_role("admin"))],
    ) -> InviteResult:
        ...

or router-level:

    APIRouter(prefix="/users", dependencies=[Depends(require_role("admin"))])

`require_role` (F3) gates by workspace role. `require_kb_acl` (F8) gates by
per-KB access: it consults the `kb_acl` store via `app.state.rbac_backend`.
Workspace admins pass `require_kb_acl` unconditionally (ADR-0027); other users
need a direct `kb_acl` grant at the required role or higher — group-inherited
access resolves once F6 member sync lands.

Per-endpoint application is opt-in (W24c plan §4 R-W24c-3): routers attach
`require_role(...)` / `require_kb_acl(...)` as each endpoint lands, rather than
a blanket gate.
